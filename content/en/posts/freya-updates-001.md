It's been a week of active development for [Freya](https://nightblue.io/).

We've opened up the dashboard [here](https://prism-chi-lovat.vercel.app/). You can try it out for free for a month. Don't worry about the **Prism** name; it's an internal codename we use for Freya.

So, what do you get from the trial? If you connect your GitHub organization, you'll get **daily, weekly, and monthly reports and insights about your team, and their GitHub activities**. Soon, we will open up the following integrations:

- Slack,
- MS Teams,
- JIRA,
- ClickUp,
- Google Workspace,
- MS SharePoint, OneDrive,
- and many more!

You might say, **"What's the point of these reports? My existing tool already supports this."**

Most of the report generation capabilities of these tools are within the bounds of the data available within the tools themselves. You want a tool that has access to as much contextual data as it can to generate more accurate reports. You can use these reports as your baseline data for some of the following use cases:

- Performance reviews,
- Onboarding new members,
- Sprint reviews and retrospectives,
- Progress sharing to other stakeholders,
- Contextual project/product Q&A,
- and many more!

In terms of pricing, no, we haven't finalized that yet. You can use Freya **for free** for now **in exchange for your feedback**. If you think it's crap, please tell us. If you have a specific feature in mind that can make this tool useful to you, by all means please tell us, and we'll do the work.

Try it out [here](https://prism-chi-lovat.vercel.app/).
