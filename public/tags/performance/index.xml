      <description>&lt;p&gt;This theme has a (near) &lt;a href=&#34;https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-www-hugobricks-preview-usecue-com/je4uqrt6nj?form_factor=mobile&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;perfect Google Lighthouse score&lt;/a&gt;. Some people like fast cars. I like fast websites. But how to get to a perfect Google Lighthouse score? Let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You might feel that it is nearly impossible to get to a perfect 100% score. You minified your Javascript, properly scaled your images and even combined some requests, but that did not help nearly enough. The problem is: you might be looking at it from the wrong angle. I build 100% scoring websites on a daily basis, so obviously it is very well possible to get a perfect score on all your websites with little effort. I will try to explain what we want to achieve and how we can achieve that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
